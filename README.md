== GBA Emulator Written in Haskell ==
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intolerable/GroupProject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intolerable/GroupProject)

This is an attempt to create an emulator for the Gameboy Advance using Haskell and functional pardigms, the motivation
for this being that anybody could write an emulator in a systems language such as C, it takes a whole other kind of programmer to do this to themselves.
